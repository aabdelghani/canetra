# CANetra: Multi-node CAN Debugger

## Overview
CANetra is a sophisticated tool designed for debugging and monitoring multi-node Controller Area Network (CAN) setups, specifically tailored for the STM32 Nucleo-F303RE microcontroller. This project aims to provide a comprehensive platform for automotive engineers and developers working with CAN networks, facilitating real-time network traffic analysis, diagnostics, and effective message logging.

## Features
- **Real-Time CAN Network Monitoring**: Visualize and analyze traffic on CAN networks in real-time.
- **Advanced Diagnostics**: Perform diagnostics on multiple nodes, identifying network errors and issues.
- **Efficient Message Logging**: Record, store, and analyze CAN messages for in-depth examination.
- **STM32 Nucleo-F303RE Compatibility**: Custom-built for compatibility with the STM32 Nucleo-F303RE platform.
- **Intuitive User Interface**: Easy-to-use interface for efficient monitoring and debugging.
- **Data Export and Analysis**: Export recorded data for further analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- STM32 Nucleo-F303RE board
- SN65HVD230 CAN Bus Transceiver Module
- Software requirements (e.g., STM32CubeIDE, appropriate drivers)

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**:
git clone https://github.com/your-username/CANetra.git

2. **Setup the Development Environment**:
